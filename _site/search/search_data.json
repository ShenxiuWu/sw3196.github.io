EGaIn) inside flexible microchannels. When stretched, the geometry of the channels changes resulting in a change of resistance. By measuring the change in resistance it is possible to calculate the strain (or amount of stretching).This documentation set contains files and instructions to support the design, fabrication, modeling, and testing of a specific EGaIn Sensor. The main functional component of the sensor is a thin structure made of soft, hyperelastic silicone elastomer containing the microchannels. The thin elastomer is connected to a stiffer elastomer and hook-and-loop fasteners for easy attachment to external devices and components.HeadersHeader 1Header 2Header 3StylingBoldItalicsBold and ItalicsLists      Item 1        Item 2        Unordered Item                  Sub Item 1                  Bold Sub Sub Ordered Item                    LinksIn-LineI’m a reference-style link 1I’m a reference-style link 1ImagesHold your pointer clicked over the image to expand the view.CodeInline code.import numpy as npdef hello_world():    print(&#39;Hello World!&#39;&#39;)MathJaxUse MathJax for Math.Tables            Here      is      a      row!                  is      Left      Center      Right              a      cut      it      A              column      short      B      C      Quotes  War does not decide who is right, only who is left.RuleHTMLCan write the whole post or sections in HTML for very specific needs.

Although the scalability, customizability, and diversity of soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) are widely recognized, comprehensive techniques for modeling and designing soft actuators are lacking.

      "content"	 : "SDM FingersShape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) is a rapid prototyping process in which mechanisms are simultaneously fabricated and assembled through alternating steps of subtractive (milling) and additive (casting) manufacturing. One of the advantages of this process is that it is possible to embed items (such as sensors, motors, or structural reinforcements) into the mechanism you are building. Further information on SDM can be found here: [External link].In this documentation set we will use SDM to build multi-jointed, compliant fingers that are actuated by pulling a cable. This technique is based on work carried out at Harvard (Dollar &amp;amp; Howe, 2006) and Stanford (Binnard &amp;amp; Cutosky, 2000) to build graspers for dexterous robot manipulation.Hold your pointer clicked over the image to expand the view.HeadersHeader 1Header 2Header 3StylingBoldItalicsBold and ItalicsLists      Item 1        Item 2        Unordered Item                  Sub Item 1                  Bold Sub Sub Ordered Item                    LinksIn-LineI’m a reference-style link 1I’m a reference-style link 1ImagesHold your pointer clicked over the image to expand the view.CodeInline code.import numpy as npdef hello_world():    print(&#39;Hello World!&#39;&#39;)MathJaxUse MathJax for Math.Tables            Here      is      a      row!                  is      Left      Center      Right              a      cut      it      A              column      short      B      C      Quotes  War does not decide who is right, only who is left.RuleHTMLCan write the whole post or sections in HTML for very specific needs.
